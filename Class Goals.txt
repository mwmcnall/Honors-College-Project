Class Goals

	So for this branch I want to focus on getting the class in the way that I want. Here are some basic ideas I have atm that I want
	to accomplish
	
	Organizational goals:
		- Make nans more efficient by not having a comparison on every
		iteration
		- Update _type_correction() with all necessary changes
		- Write a proper docstring for _feature_engineering()
	
	Methods
		- _div_featuers and _bin_featuers are almost exactly the same,
		I'm sure I can abstract them into a single function that takes
		in a dictionary instead
		- New method to handle all the ethnicity data summation
		- New method to handle summation of all grade data
