Class Goals

	So for this branch I want to focus on getting the class in the way that I want. Here are some basic ideas I have atm that I want
	to accomplish
	
	Organizational goals:
		- Make nans more efficient by not having a comparison on every
		iteration
		- Update _type_correction() with all necessary changes
		- Write a proper docstring for _feature_engineering()
		- The assignment within _feature_engineering() is lazy and should be put in a better spot somewhere
