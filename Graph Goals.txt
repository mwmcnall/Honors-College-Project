Graph Goals

	Now that the class is defined and my data munging / feature engineering is
	here I want it to be, I want to do some basic graphs and exploring of the dataset

	Organizational goals:
		- Sketch some graphs that I want to create
		- ***Separate this into more than one file for testing purposes please.

	Classes
		- Create a class that inherits from Graph, DataCleaner and DataContainer
			So I can utilize all those same methods subsets of DataFrames

	Methods
		- Overwrite the groupby method

	Ideas
		So, what is the next goal for graphs? What do we want to visualize currently?
		I want to work with Total Prop 4 % and the Math / ELA variants of those, but the question becomes:
			- What do you want to compare it against?
			- What type of graph do you want to utilize?
		- Average ELA / Math Proficiency

	Notes
		- Interesting relationships
			- Percentage of white students is HIGHLY correlated with all measures of
				Attendance, Rigorous Instruction, Strong Community Family Ties,
				Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership and Collaborative
				Teachers
			- Seems to a correlation between School Income Estimate and grades. Schools with younger students seem to get more money than schools with older Students
			-

	Since last commit
		- Added regression line method
		- Can generate pearsonr values for a single column easily with a method
