Graph Goals

	Now that the class is defined and my data munging / feature engineering is
	here I want it to be, I want to do some basic graphs and exploring of the dataset

	Organizational goals:
		- Sketch some graphs that I want to create
		- Find out how to update github from Atom

	Classes
		- Create a Graph class that has all the graphing methods and necessary
			variables in a separate place than Data
		- Graph has to be able to graph, which means it has to have access to data,
			therefore, it must inherit from Data. But, does that mean that Data is bad
			name for the class? I think so.
		-	DataContainer
			- DataCleaner
			- Graph
				- SchoolData

	Methods
		- Create some specific graphing methods for each Class
		- Organize classes in order, privates and publics together, by theme, etc.

	Ideas
		So, what is the next goal for graphs? What do we want to visualize currently?
		I want to work with Total Prop 4 % and the Math / ELA variants of those, but the question becomes:
			- What do you want to compare it against?
			- What type of graph do you want to utilize?
		- Average ELA / Math Proficiency


	Notes
