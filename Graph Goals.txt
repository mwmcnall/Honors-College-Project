Graph Goals

	Now that the class is defined and my data munging / feature engineering is where I want it to be, I want to do some basic graphs
	and exploring of the dataset
	
	Organizational goals:
		- Sketch some graphs that I want to create
	
	Methods
		- Create some specific graphing methods for each Class
		
	Ideas
		So, what is the next goal for graphs? What do we want to visualize currently?
		I want to work with Total Prop 4 % and the Math / ELA varients of those, but the question becomes:
			- What do you want to compare it against?
			- What type of graph do you want to utilize?
		- Average ELA / Math Proficiency
		
		
	Notes
		- There are schools where the Percent of students chronically absent is 100%
		- Student Tested 4s is > Student Tested Totals in a few schools, which should be impossible
			The reason this happens is that the way I calculate 'Student Tested 4s' is by adding all the totals of 'Math Tested 4s' for each grade
			to 'ELA Tested 4s' for each grade. And the way I calculate 'Student Tested Total' is by adding 'Math Tested Total' for each grade to 
			'ELA Tested Total' for each grade. So therefore, if there is enough overlap of kids who score 4s on both, than it's possible to get
			a situation where you get over 100% 'Total 4 %'. I think this is less about changing how I calculate the column, and more giving it a more
			accurate name. It no longer represents the 'Total 4 %' of the school, it now more represents the 'Success %', which sounds a little more vague
			but is more accurate. I think if I calcualte the 'Total Math 4 %' and the 'Total ELA 4 %' than average them, that will be more accurate
			of a representation.
		- 'Math Tested Total' is returning 0 for some rows. My theory is that it's not counting 'Grade 3' correctly
