Graph Goals

	Now that the class is defined and my data munging / feature engineering is where I want it to be,
	I want to do some basic graphs and exploring of the dataset

	Organizational goals:
		- Sketch some graphs that I want to create
		- Find out how to update github from Atom

	Classes
		- Create a Graph class that has all the graphing methods and necessary
			variables in a separate place than Data

	Methods
		- Create some specific graphing methods for each Class
		- Ensure that each method does ONLY one thing
		- Are all the methods within a class meant for that Class? Should they be split into a different class?
		- Organize classes in order, privates and publics together, by theme, etc.

	Ideas
		So, what is the next goal for graphs? What do we want to visualize currently?
		I want to work with Total Prop 4 % and the Math / ELA variants of those, but the question becomes:
			- What do you want to compare it against?
			- What type of graph do you want to utilize?
		- Average ELA / Math Proficiency


	Notes
		- 'Math Tested Total' is returning 0 for some rows. My theory is that it's not counting 'Grade 3' correctly
			- Grade 3 is definitely not showing
		- Fixed an issue where Grade 3 wasn't represented in 'Grade 3 Math Tested Total' Because
		of a spelling mistake not being fixed before the sum
