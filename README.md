# Schools In Need

PASSNYC is a not-for-profit organization that released [a dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good#2016%20School%20Explorer.csv) all about schools in New York and the scores different students recieved on the SHSAT. The SHSAT is a standardized test used to see how prepared a student is for the next grade, and [this is an analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mwmcnall/Honors-College-Project/blob/master/Honors%20College%20Data%20stuff.slides.html) on what schools are most in need based on their scores on the SHSAT and other variables.
